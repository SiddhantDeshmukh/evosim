# Evosim

This is a personal project in Rust built to explore evolution at a basic sense.
Creatures will have different attributes like speed, satiation, and
strength. Attributes will be passed down from parent to offspring. The
current environment is a 2D "sea" with creatures swimming around.

## To-Do

- [x] Basic creature spawning
- [x] Spawning food
- [x] One creature just moving around and eating (collision and senses)
- [x] Plant & Meat food sources with separate spawning mechanics
- [ ] Hunting / fleeing behaviours
- [ ] Zoom functionality to allow much larger scales but only render what is
      on-screen
- [ ] HP, age, size attributes for creatures
- [ ] Reproduction mechanics to pass on traits
- [ ] Trait system that changes attributes
- [ ] Predators with chasing mechanics
- [ ] Try to reproduce Lotka-Volterra stability
- [ ] Periodic boundaries on sides with upgraded distance calculations
